1. creating basic Project

2. Adding Links
  -> adding link thorough simple link tag

3. Styling Pages -> vanilla CSS, Tailwind CSS
  -> used vanilla CSS 

4. Adding Component Styling
  -> Remix does not directly link styles on importing
  -> we have to use link method like in html we do.
  -> syntax:
    import styles from './styles.css';
    export function links(){
      return [{rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles}];
    }
  -> here default component will atomatically look for the link tag if present then add links to the code.

5. Active Link Styling 
  -> To give active link a different color we have used NavLink.

6. Adding Form Storage Operation
  -> Created Form with simple fomr tag that we use in html, react.
7. Storing data in json file
  -> In Remix we do not use useState, useEffect to handle form data.
  -> we use action method to fetch form data and store it.

8. retriving that stored data.
  -> In Remix we use Loader function whenever we have to fetch the data from database or some component.
  
9. Error Handling -> route error, form error, data error
10. Dynamic Routing -> creating and fetching data through it
// 9 and 10 not working properly
